<h1> About </h1>
Noteist pronounce as "Notice" is a simple web application with minimal design that can create notes and to-do list for your productivity. It is responsive so that you can use this on any device and it also has a dark mode to protect your eyes from the light. This is my first project made with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
